    <h1>Computer Software</h1>
    <p>Software consists of computer programs that instruct the execution of a computer. Software also includes design documents and specifications. The history of software is closely tied to the development of digital computers in the mid-20th century. Early programs were written in the machine language specific to the hardware. The introduction of high-level programming languages in 1958 allowed for more human-readable instructions, making software development easier and more portable across different computer architectures.</p>

            <td>A system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system. It may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.</td>
            <td>A software that is intended for end-user use, not operating, administering or programming a computer. An application (app, application program, software application) is any program that can be categorized as application software. Application is a subjective classification that is often used to differentiate from system and utility software.</td>
